        <p>
            I have a freckle in the webbing of my fingers. I have met Lin Manuel Miranda, writer of Hamilton. 
            I did not know there was a difference between a duck and a goose until the age of 22.

        <p>
            My first pet is named Cinderblock. She is really fat. I think that one is pretty self explanatory. 
            Next we adopted Jake from State Farm. 
            He is a dapper little man with a bow tie.
            Next we got a pandemic kitten who now has separation anxiety, his name is Chicken Nugget. 
            Other Known Aliases: A Whole Heckin Chicken, Mr. Nug Butt.
